* Haveing a type of version control for the data or models scores help alot in error analyzing and Verifying assumptions.
    Such as in this project:
        - Feature selection seems always helps.
        - Outlier removal for in trap duration doesn't help.
        - Increase polynomials degree doesn't help use (seems Nonlinear transformation doesn't help).
              
* Because our target in a small scale we need to do transformation equivalent to our feature to help the model learn the target easily
(We need always to think about transformation can help to learn target easily).

* We can easily do data leakage problems without notice so we need always to have test set keeped away from all we doing.
