# Sections Overview
-  Data Inspection: In this section, we start by inspecting the dataset to understand its structure and contents. It includes loading the data and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- Analysis Features and Feature Engineering: This section dives deeper into data analysis and feature engineering. It covers:

  - Analyzing the target variable.
  - Examining discrete numerical features.
  - Handling categorical variables.
  - Dealing with geographical data.
  - Performing temporal and time-date analysis.
  - Correlation Analysis: This section likely discusses any correlations between variables in the dataset. It can include correlation matrices, heatmaps, or other     
    visualizations to reveal relationships between features.

- Modeling: This section might involve building predictive models, such as regression or machine learning models, based on the dataset to make predictions related to trip      duration.

- Save the Data: This section suggests saving or preserving the data for future reference or sharing.
